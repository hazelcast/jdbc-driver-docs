= Securing the Connection

You can use TLS/SSL to secure the communication between the JDBC driver and the cluster.
TLS/SSL must be enabled and configured both on the driver and cluster sides.

See https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jdbc#ssl-properties[TLS/SSL Properties] for the descriptions of the JDBC driver configuration elements, and xref:hazelcast:security:tls-ssl.adoc[TLS/SSL for Members] to configure the cluster side.
